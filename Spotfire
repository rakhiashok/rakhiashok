Our main concern, issue while we will face while connecting Table function.

Since notable object we might not be able to locate the table (Table function is actually an imaginary table for us to understand)

Steps we may need to follow
1. Find the total number of columns which needed to be captured.
2. Create same number of columns from the same database (Spotfire can rename and change the data type)
3. Modify the SQL  and point to the table function. 
4. Last and final step executes and see if you are able to open the open the table function without any issue. 
I hope this can help someone. Incase if you face any issue I request you to connect with me. Good Luck
